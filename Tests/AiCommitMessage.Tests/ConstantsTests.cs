/// The classifications include various types such as 'feat', 'fix', 'docs',
/// 'test', 'build', 'perf', 'style', 'refactor', 'chore', 'ci', 'raw',
/// 'cleanup', and 'remove'. Each type is accompanied by a brief description
/// that helps developers understand the purpose of the commit. The test

            Recommended type - description of changes in up to 10 words in English.

        // Act
        var actual = Constants.SystemMessage;

        // Assert
